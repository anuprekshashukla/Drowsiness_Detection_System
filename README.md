<h1>Drowsiness Detection System(webapp)</h1>
<h2>Motivation:</h2>
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, every year about 100,000 police-reported crashes involve drowsy driving. These crashes result in more than 1,550 fatalities and 71,000 injuries. The real number may be much higher, however, as it is difficult to determine whether a driver was drowsy at the time of a crash. So, we tried to build a system, that detects whether a person is drowsy and alert him<br>
<h2>Installing and Configuring dlib:</h2>
We need to create an enivronment in order to install dlib, as it cannot be directly installed using pip. So, follow this commands in order to install dlib into your system if you haven't installed it previously. Make sure you have Anaconda installed, as we will be doing everyting in Anaconda Prompt.<br><br>
